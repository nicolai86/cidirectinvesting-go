This is a Go SDK for the [CI Direct Investing](https://cidirectinvesting.com/) application.

I couldn't find an official SDK, so here's just what I need to integrate it into my home system.

## Running all tests locally

```bash
CDI_KEY_ID=<access key> CDI_SECRET_KEY=<secret key> go test ./... -v
```
